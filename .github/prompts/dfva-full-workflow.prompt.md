description: Run the complete DFVA three-report workflow for any program URL or UniMelb course code. Sequences assessment → market intelligence → improvement plan, then saves all three reports as markdown files and updates both prototype apps (compass-static and compass/app). Use when you want to run the full pipeline in one shot.

Run the full DFVA workflow for the program below. Execute all five stages in sequence. Do not skip stages.

**Input:** ${input:Program URL or UniMelb course code (e.g. https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2026/courses/b-sci or just b-sci)}

---

## Stage 1 — Resolve the handbook URL

If the input is a full URL, use it directly as the primary source.
If the input is a course code (e.g. `b-sci`, `mc-is`), construct the URL:
`https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2026/courses/[COURSE-CODE]`

Fetch the handbook page. Extract:
- Program name
- Institution (default: University of Melbourne)
- Level (Bachelor / Master / PhD / Certificate / Diploma)
- Duration
- Named majors, units, or specialisations listed
- Any stated graduate outcomes or career information

Derive the course-code slug from the URL (e.g. `b-sci`, `mc-is`, `b-des`). All saved files use this slug.

---

## Stage 2 — DFVA Viability Assessment

Apply the full DFVA rubric from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Score all 10 dimensions plus bonus (0–3 each). Compute total /36 and risk band.

**Required output sections (exact order):**
1. PROGRAM PROFILE
2. AUTOMATION EXPOSURE PROFILE (table: Year / Typical Tasks / Automation Risk)
3. DFVA SCORECARD (table with all 11 rows + evidence)
4. THREE THRESHOLD QUESTIONS (Q1/Q2/Q3 with YES, NO, or UNCERTAIN and rationale)
5. ANALOGUE GRADUATE PROFILE
6. VERDICT (commit to a risk band; no hedging)
7. RECOMMENDATIONS (table: Priority / Action / Dimension / Effort)
8. THE REDESIGNED GRADUATE PROFILE (~200 words)

**Risk bands:** 28–36 RESILIENT · 20–27 MODERATE RISK · 12–19 HIGH RISK · 0–11 CRITICAL

---

## Stage 3 — Market Intelligence Scan

Generate a labour-market evidence pack for years 1–5 post-graduation. Base on documented hiring trend data, ANZ job-market signals, and professional discourse. State confidence level explicitly.

**Required output sections (exact order):**
1. JOB FAMILY MAP (4–8 families; table: Job Family / Typical Entry Titles / Core Tasks / AI Substitution Pressure / Skills Increasing in Demand / Evidence Notes)
2. RECENT JOB AD SIGNALS (5–6 named signals with direction and curriculum meaning)
3. CURRENT DISCUSSION SIGNALS (X) (5–7 named themes)
4. SKILL SHIFT SUMMARY (two tables: Declining Demand and Rising Demand, each with Skill / Driver / Velocity)
5. CURRICULUM IMPLICATIONS (table: # / Implication / Dimension / Recommended Action)
6. EVIDENCE CONFIDENCE + GAPS (table + critical gaps list)

---

## Stage 4 — Curriculum Improvement Plan

Convert the assessment and market evidence into an implementation-ready improvement plan. Every intervention must map to DFVA dimensions and include a market signal link.

**Required output sections (exact order):**
1. DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY (score table for all 11 dimensions)
2. SCORE-TO-ACTION MAPPING (table: Dimension / DFVA Score / Gap Diagnosis / Recommended Intervention)
3. MARKET EVIDENCE SNAPSHOT (table: Job Family / Recent Hiring Signal / X Discussion Theme / Curriculum Impact)
4. PRIORITIZED INTERVENTIONS TABLE (table: Priority / Action / Target Dimensions / Market Signal Link / Impact / Effort / Owner / Timeline / KPI)
5. 12-MONTH IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (plain text phases — do NOT use fenced code blocks)
6. 24-MONTH CAPABILITY ROADMAP (plain text phases with score trajectory — do NOT use fenced code blocks)
7. ASSESSMENT REDESIGN EXAMPLES (2–3 specific unit redesigns)
8. AI GOVERNANCE AND QUALITY CONTROLS
9. MEASUREMENT PLAN (leading and lagging indicators tables)
10. RISKS, TRADE-OFFS, AND DEPENDENCIES (table + narrative)
11. REDESIGNED GRADUATE PROFILE (2027 READY) (~200 words)

## Stage 5 — Save Reports and Update Prototypes

Save the three reports as markdown files and add them to both prototype apps.

### 5a — Save report files

Save Stage 2 output as: `reports/dfva-[slug].md`
Save Stage 3 output as: `reports/dfva-market-[slug].md`
Save Stage 4 output as: `reports/dfva-recommend-[slug].md`

Each file must include this metadata footer:
```
Assessment Date: [ISO date]
Source URL: [handbook URL]
Prompt Version: DFVA-COPILOT-PROMPT-v1 / DFVA-COPILOT-MARKET-v1 / DFVA-COPILOT-RECOMMENDER-v1
```

### 5b — Add report content entries

Add three new entries to BOTH of these files:
- `compass-static/src/data/reportContent.ts`
- `compass/app/src/compass/reportContent.ts`

Entry shape (repeat for all three slugs):
```typescript
"dfva-[slug]": {
  title: "[Program Name] — DFVA Assessment",
  institution: "[Institution]",
  markdown: `[full Stage 2 content, converted: no fenced code blocks inside template literal]`,
},
```

Insert before the `"dfva-market-b-des"` entry. Use Python via terminal if backtick characters in the content cause tool conflicts.

**Critical:** Template literal strings must NOT contain backtick characters. Convert any fenced code blocks (``` blocks) to plain bold-text paragraph format before embedding.

### 5c — Add PROGRAMS card entry

Add a new entry to the `PROGRAMS` array in BOTH of these files:
- `compass-static/src/pages/ReportsPage.tsx`
- `compass/app/src/compass/ReportsPage.tsx`

```typescript
{
  program: '[Program Name]',
  institution: '[Institution]',
  level: '[Level · Duration]',
  date: '[ISO date]',
  score: [total score],
  maxScore: 36,
  riskBand: '[RESILIENT | MODERATE RISK | HIGH RISK | CRITICAL]',
  thresholds: { q1: '[YES|NO|UNCERTAIN]', q2: '[YES|NO|UNCERTAIN]', q3: '[YES|NO|UNCERTAIN]' },
  dimensions: [
    { label: 'Automation Exposure', score: [D1], max: 3 },
    { label: 'Systems Thinking', score: [D2], max: 3 },
    { label: 'Technical Depth', score: [D3], max: 3 },
    { label: 'Decision-Making', score: [D4], max: 3 },
    { label: 'AI Literacy', score: [D5], max: 3 },
    { label: 'Domain Depth', score: [D6], max: 3 },
    { label: 'Research Rigour', score: [D7], max: 3 },
    { label: 'Human & Relational', score: [D8], max: 3 },
    { label: 'Curriculum Currency', score: [D9], max: 3 },
    { label: 'Outcome Evidence', score: [D10], max: 3 },
    { label: 'Irreplaceability (bonus)', score: [B], max: 3 },
  ],
  assessmentSlug: 'dfva-[slug]',
  marketSlug: 'dfva-market-[slug]',
  recommendSlug: 'dfva-recommend-[slug]',
},
```

Note: `compass/app/src/compass/ReportsPage.tsx` uses double quotes for string values; `compass-static/src/pages/ReportsPage.tsx` uses single quotes.

### 5d — Verify

Run `cd compass-static && npm run build` to confirm no TypeScript errors. Report result.

## Behavior Constraints

- Do not conflate prestige with labor-market durability.
- Commit to a score and risk band — no hedging conclusions.
- If handbook data is incomplete, state assumptions and proceed with best-evidence scoring.
- All five stages must complete before the workflow is considered done.
- Do not create additional markdown documentation files for the workflow itself.
