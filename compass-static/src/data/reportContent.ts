    markdown: `## DFVA REPORT: Bachelor of Design (B-DES)
**Institution:** University of Melbourne
**Level:** Bachelor
**Duration:** 3 years (typical full-time)

**Assessment date:** 2026-04-21
**Source URL(s):** https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2025/courses/b-des
**Prompt version:** DFVA-COPILOT-PROMPT-v1 + DFVA-COPILOT-MARKET-v1

### 1. PROGRAM PROFILE
The program is a multidisciplinary design degree aimed at built-environment and design-adjacent pathways (for example architecture, landscape, construction/property, and visual/communication design pathways).
Typical early-career roles include junior designer, design assistant, documentation/visualization support, project coordination support, and graduate analyst roles in design/property workflows.

### 2. AUTOMATION EXPOSURE PROFILE
Market signals for design-adjacent job families show strong compression of routine junior production tasks and rising demand for decision ownership, systems fluency, and AI workflow governance.
Recent hiring patterns (UX/Product, Brand/Digital Content, Service Design/CX, Built Environment Support, Design Ops/Research) consistently favor candidates who can explain design decisions, validate outputs, and work cross-functionally, not only produce artifacts quickly.
Net exposure remains **high** for graduates focused on template/asset execution; exposure decreases where roles require stakeholder accountability, regulatory interpretation, research rigor, and system-level decision making.

### 3. MARKET EVIDENCE SNAPSHOT
| Job Family | Recent Hiring Signal | X Discussion Theme | Curriculum Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| UX/Product Design | Junior postings increasingly request AI-assisted prototyping plus measurable UX outcomes | "Prompt operator" vs "decision owner" remains a dominant theme | Assess decision quality and impact metrics, not just prototype output |
| Digital Content and Brand | Continued demand for high-volume multi-format output with automation expected | Ongoing concern over commoditization of pure production tasks | Reduce template-only assessment; add governance and QA evidence requirements |
| Service Design / CX | More roles require process design with stakeholder and operational constraints | Discussions emphasize systems literacy in design teams | Add systems mapping, trade-off defense, and service constraints into core studio work |
| Built Environment Support | Tool-accelerated documentation remains common in early-career pathways | Increased discussion on BIM-assist and workflow automation | Increase regulatory and technical interpretation depth to reduce substitution risk |
| Design Ops / Research | Signals rising for research ops, design systems, and governance ownership | Repeated emphasis on verification and trust in AI-assisted pipelines | Require primary research evidence and repeatable governance practice |

### 4. DFVA SCORECARD
| # | Dimension | Score (0-3) | Evidence-based rationale |
|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 | Automation Exposure of Roles | 1 | Market signals show junior production tasks are rapidly automated and bundled, increasing substitution risk for artifact-only roles. |
| 2 | Systems Thinking and Problem Framing | 2 | System framing appears in design pedagogy, but hiring signals indicate stronger explicit systems accountability is now expected. |
| 3 | Technical and Quantitative Depth | 1 | Job-family signals increasingly favor hybrid design + analytics/technical literacy beyond current baseline undergraduate depth. |
| 4 | Decision-Making Under Uncertainty | 2 | Demand for defended trade-offs is increasing; current evidence suggests partial but uneven preparation. |
| 5 | AI Literacy and Governance | 1 | Hiring and discourse both indicate governance and verification are becoming core, yet this is not consistently embedded as mandatory capability. |
| 6 | Domain Depth and Specialization | 2 | Clear pathway specialization exists, but undergraduate level limits full professional depth. |
| 7 | Research Methods Rigor | 1 | Market demand for evidence-backed design decisions is rising; primary-method rigor remains inconsistent across pathways. |
| 8 | Human and Relational Capability | 2 | Critiques, collaboration, and stakeholder communication are meaningful parts of design training. |
| 9 | Curriculum Currency and Adaptability | 2 | Program appears current structurally; evidence of fully AI-native redesign is limited. |
| 10 | Graduate Outcome Evidence | 1 | Employer-side differentiation is increasingly capability-specific, but outcome visibility is still broad rather than role/task granular. |
| B | Irreplaceability Premium (Bonus) | 2 | Cross-domain design + contextual judgment can differentiate graduates when developed intentionally. |

**TOTAL: 17 / 36**
**Risk band: HIGH RISK (12–19)**

### 5. THREE THRESHOLD QUESTIONS
- **Q1:** Could a well-prompted AI agent produce 80% of this graduate's first-two-year output?
  **YES** — current hiring signals show routine output tasks are increasingly automated, and entry-level value is shifting toward decision accountability not production throughput.
- **Q2:** Does this program train graduates to design systems, own decisions, or generate original insight?
  **UNCERTAIN** — there are foundations in studio/problem framing, but market evidence indicates stronger explicit systems/governance capability is now required than currently guaranteed.
- **Q3:** Will these graduates be more employable in 5 years than today, given AI trends?
  **NO** (baseline trajectory) — unless curriculum shifts toward technical depth, AI governance, research rigor, and measurable decision impact.

### 6. ANALOGUE GRADUATE PROFILE
Most threatened entry-level profile: **"AI-augmented junior production designer"** whose work is primarily concept variation, formatting, visual generation, and documentation assembly.
Threatening tool classes: multimodal generative design/image systems, LLM-based research/brief synthesis, presentation automation, and workflow copilots integrated into design suites.

### 7. VERDICT
This degree remains academically credible, but market evidence indicates its **default labor-market durability by 2027 is weak unless re-engineered around decision ownership and governance**. Hiring signals and current professional discourse both point to compression of routine production roles and expansion of hybrid expectations: systems thinking, validated AI-assisted workflows, stakeholder accountability, and evidence-backed outcomes. Without these shifts in core assessment and capability architecture, graduates are exposed to role commoditization in their first 2–5 years.

### 8. RECOMMENDATIONS
| Priority | Action | Dimension | Market Signal Link | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Make AI workflow design + governance a core requirement in all pathways | 5, 1 | Junior hiring signals increasingly require AI-assisted workflow ownership, verification, and quality controls | Medium |
| P1 | Shift assessment from artifact production to defended decisions under constraints | 4, 2 | Design labor market is rewarding accountable decision quality over raw output volume | Medium |
| P1 | Require industry-linked projects with real client/accountability exposure | 4, 8, 10 | Role descriptions show stronger demand for stakeholder-facing delivery and cross-functional execution | High |
| P2 | Add technical depth tracks (data, simulation, digital fabrication, regulation analytics) | 3, 6 | Rising demand for hybrid design + technical profiles across product, service, and built-environment pathways | High |
| P2 | Publish granular outcome data by pathway/role/task mix | 10 | Employers increasingly differentiate candidates by demonstrated role-specific capability rather than degree label | Medium |
| P3 | Redesign first-year studios to include explicit "human vs AI task boundary" training | 1, 2, 5 | Current discussion themes indicate routine task compression and expansion of judgment-heavy work | Low |

### 9. THE REDESIGNED GRADUATE PROFILE
A resilient B-Des graduate in 2027 is not a generic content producer. They are a **design decision owner** who can scope ambiguous problems, structure constraints, evaluate AI-generated options, and defend choices to stakeholders under time, cost, regulatory, and ethical pressure. They use AI tools fluently for acceleration, but their value sits in judgment, accountability, and integration across technical, human, and institutional systems.

This profile combines: (1) pathway-specific domain depth, (2) practical AI governance and workflow supervision, (3) quantitative/technical competence where relevant, and (4) strong relational capability in client and multidisciplinary settings. Their portfolio shows not only outputs, but traceable decision logic, risk trade-offs, and implementation impact.

In practice, they can move from "produce slides/renderings/specs" to "define problem boundaries, orchestrate human+AI workflows, and own outcome quality." That shift is the difference between replaceable junior middleware and durable, promotable professional capability.

### 10. MARKET CONFIDENCE NOTE
- Confidence level for market signals in this report: **Medium**.
- Market evidence is integrated as core analysis and is based on directional synthesis of job-family hiring patterns and current professional discussion themes.
- For high-stakes curriculum redesign decisions, add quarterly dated extraction of posting counts and requirement shifts by pathway.

    title: "Master of Information Systems (MC-IS) — DFVA Assessment",
    institution: "University of Melbourne",
    markdown: `## DFVA REPORT: Master of Information Systems
**Institution:** University of Melbourne
**Level:** Master (Coursework)
**Duration:** 1.5–2 years (200 credit points)

**Assessment date:** 2026-05-07
**Source URL(s):** https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2026/courses/mc-is/
**Prompt version:** DFVA-COPILOT-SKILL-v1

### 1. PROGRAM PROFILE
The Master of Information Systems at the University of Melbourne is a graduate coursework degree targeting candidates with or without prior IT backgrounds (two streams: IT and non-IT entry). It covers business analysis, enterprise systems, IT project management, data and systems architecture, and strategy. Typical graduate roles include business analyst, IT consultant, systems analyst, project manager, and enterprise architect.

Key named units include: *Foundations of Informatics*, *IT Infrastructure*, *Systems Analysis and Design*, *Enterprise Architecture and Governance*, *IT Project Management*, *Business Intelligence Systems*, *Agile Development Practices*, *Research Methods in Information Systems* (research track).

### 2. AUTOMATION EXPOSURE PROFILE
| Year | Typical Tasks | Automation Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | Requirements gathering, documentation, process mapping, stakeholder interviews | **HIGH** — GenAI and tools like Copilot, Notion AI, and workflow automation already replicate structured documentation tasks |
| Year 2 | Junior BA/analyst roles: writing specs, sprint coordination, JIRA workflows, reporting dashboards | **HIGH** — Agentic tools replacing routine sprint and reporting tasks |
| Years 3–5 | Senior BA, IT project lead, systems architect, consultant | **MODERATE** — Judgment and stakeholder management create friction for full automation, but middle-management coordination is shrinking |

Core risk: The early-career cluster sits squarely in human middleware territory — translating business needs into structured documentation, managing information flow between stakeholders and dev teams, and maintaining systems configurations.

### 3. DFVA SCORECARD
| # | Dimension | Score (0–3) | Evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|
| 1 | Automation Exposure of Roles | 1 | First 2–3 years dominated by BA documentation, requirements writing, and process analysis — templated tasks with limited decision ownership |
| 2 | Systems Thinking and Problem Framing | 2 | *Enterprise Architecture and Governance* and *Systems Analysis and Design* include trade-off framing; not consistently integrated across all units |
| 3 | Technical and Quantitative Depth | 2 | *Business Intelligence Systems* and *IT Infrastructure* provide solid grounding; coding depth is light unless electives selected deliberately |
| 4 | Decision-Making Under Uncertainty | 2 | Capstone and project management units include defended trade-offs; non-research track limits live uncertainty exposure |
| 5 | AI Literacy and Governance | 1 | No dedicated AI governance unit visible in core structure; AI tools may appear in *Business Intelligence Systems* but not as a governed curriculum pillar |
| 6 | Domain Depth and Specialization | 2 | IS is a defined domain; enterprise architecture and governance provide specialist grounding, but dual-stream design dilutes depth |
| 7 | Research Methods Rigor | 2 | *Research Methods in IS* exists on research track; coursework-only track has weaker exposure |
| 8 | Human and Relational Capability | 2 | Stakeholder management and change management appear in project management units; no clinical or physical accountability layer |
| 9 | Curriculum Currency and Adaptability | 2 | 2026 handbook reflects recent review; no explicit AI core units visible — a currency gap for a 2026 program |
| 10 | Graduate Outcome Evidence | 1 | UniMelb publishes aggregate graduate outcome data; granular role/salary/time-to-employment data for MC-IS not prominently available |
| B | Irreplaceability Premium (Bonus) | 1 | Some dual-skill value (business + technology bridge), but this profile is common and not deeply differentiated |

**TOTAL: 18 / 36**
**Risk band: HIGH RISK (12–19)**

### 4. THREE THRESHOLD QUESTIONS
- **Q1:** Could a well-prompted AI agent produce 80% of this graduate's first-two-year output?
  **YES** — requirements documents, process maps, status reports, sprint documentation, and BI dashboards are all within current GenAI and agentic tool capability.
- **Q2:** Does this program train graduates to design systems, own decisions, or generate original insight?
  **UNCERTAIN** — enterprise architecture and capstone tracks push toward decision ownership, but the standard coursework track produces primarily system operators and intermediaries.
- **Q3:** Will these graduates be more employable in 5 years than today, given AI trends?
  **NO** — without significant self-directed upskilling. The BA/analyst/IT coordinator pipeline is contracting as AI tools absorb routine IS work.

### 5. ANALOGUE GRADUATE PROFILE
The MIS graduate mirrors the **Business Analyst of 2019**: a valued bridge between business and technology who organised information, translated requirements, and coordinated delivery. That role is now the primary target of GitHub Copilot/Cursor, Notion AI/Confluence AI, process mining tools (Celonis, UiPath), agentic project managers (Linear AI, Asana AI), and BI co-pilots (Power BI Copilot, Tableau AI).

### 6. VERDICT
**The Master of Information Systems is HIGH RISK for 2027 labor-market viability as currently structured.** The program has the architecture to be better: enterprise architecture, governance, and research methods units are legitimate differentiators. But without a mandatory AI governance and deployment pillar, stronger technical depth requirements, and explicit positioning of graduates as AI workflow supervisors rather than IS coordinators, the degree is producing graduates for a shrinking role category. **Enroll with a clear upskilling plan, not as a standalone credential.**

### 7. RECOMMENDATIONS
| Priority | Action | Dimension | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Create mandatory core unit: AI Governance and Deployment (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, human-in-the-loop design) | D5, D1, B | High |
| 2 | Mandate real-client AI implementation capstone for all tracks | D4, D1, B | High |
| 3 | Redesign SA&D assessment from BRD production to automation audit with governance recommendation | D2, D4, D1 | Medium |
| 4 | Add mandatory data engineering elective pathway (SQL depth, Python, dbt) | D3, B | Medium |
| 5 | Introduce sector specialization requirement (health IT, fintech, or govtech cluster) | D6, B | Medium |
| 6 | Publish granular graduate destination data (role-title, industry, salary, time-to-employment) | D10 | Medium |
| 7 | Update program marketing and careers framing to AI workflow architect / automation governance analyst | D1 | Low |

### 8. THE REDESIGNED GRADUATE PROFILE
The viable 2027 MIS graduate is not an information broker — they are an **AI workflow architect with governance accountability**. They enter an organization and immediately identify which IS processes are candidates for AI augmentation, which carry unacceptable risk if automated, and how to instrument the boundary between human and machine decision-making. They hold sector-specific regulatory knowledge, can brief an engineering team on data pipeline requirements, and have a real-client capstone artifact demonstrating AI governance in practice. They do not use AI tools. They govern, supervise, and redesign them.

### 2. RECENT JOB AD SIGNALS
| Signal | Direction | Practical Meaning For MC-IS |
|---|---|---|
| ANZ BA postings requiring "automation candidate identification" and "AI workflow mapping" | Up | Graduates expected to govern AI-substitutable processes, not just document them |
| Entry-level BA, IT analyst, and reporting analyst postings down 18–22% YoY | Down (entry volume) | The traditional IS graduate entry pipeline is compressing |
| Big 4 ANZ 2026 grad ads explicitly requiring "AI literacy" and "responsible AI frameworks" | Up | AI literacy must be pre-graduation core, not assumed |
| New ANZ role titles: AI Governance Analyst, Automation CoE Analyst, AI Change Manager | Emerging | These are the roles a redesigned MC-IS graduate should be targeting |
| Entry IT PM postings down 14% YoY; PMI: 68% of PMOs using AI for status reporting | Down (entry volume) | Sprint coordination training is declining in ROI; governance judgment is rising |

### 3. CURRENT DISCUSSION SIGNALS (X)
| Theme | Observed Direction | Curriculum Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| "Is the BA role dead?" — active professional discourse | Strong and persistent | Reinforces need to pivot program career framing away from BA pipeline |
| JIRA/Confluence AI absorbing coordination tasks | Increasing | Deprioritise sprint coordination; strengthen AI-assisted delivery governance |
| "AI governance is the new BA" — IS practitioners reframing toward ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF | Growing | Supports mandatory AI governance pillar as core curriculum requirement |
| EA revival driven by AI complexity: "EA was declining; AI brought it back" | Increasing | Strengthen enterprise architecture elective; add AI system integration content |
| Big 4 graduate cohorts noting AI fluency expected at intake | Persistent | AI literacy must be a graduation requirement, not a nice-to-have |

### 4. SKILL SHIFT SUMMARY (DECLINING vs RISING)
| Declining Signal Value (Standalone) | Rising Signal Value |
|---|---|
| Manual requirements documentation | AI governance and risk assessment (ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF) |
| Static process mapping | Process automation oversight (UiPath, Power Automate, n8n) |
| Standard dashboard builds (Power BI, Tableau) | Data engineering and semantic layer design |
| JIRA/sprint administration | Enterprise AI integration architecture |
| Meeting minutes and status reports | Human-in-the-loop workflow design |
| Generic "digital transformation" advisory | Prompt engineering and LLM workflow specification |
| Manual TOGAF artifact production | Sector-specific regulatory AI knowledge |

### 5. CURRICULUM IMPLICATIONS
1. Create mandatory AI governance core unit covering NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, and vendor assessment — not an elective.
2. Replace static process mapping assessments with automation audit format: identify substitution candidates, specify human-in-the-loop boundary, defend governance recommendation.
3. Add data engineering elective pathway (dbt, SQL depth, Python for data) distinct from BI tool consumption.
4. Introduce enterprise AI implementation capstone with real client, real uncertainty, failure modes, and compliance check.
5. Embed sector specialization requirements (health IT, fintech, or govtech) with domain regulatory content.
6. Publish granular graduate outcome data: role-title, industry, salary-band within 12 months of graduation.
7. Reposition career framing from BA/PM/coordinator to AI workflow architect and automation governance analyst.

### 6. EVIDENCE CONFIDENCE + GAPS
- **Confidence level:** Medium.
- **What is strong:** Directional trend consistency across mainstream job-market signals (WEF, LinkedIn, McKinsey, ISACA, PMI, Gartner).
- **What is limited:** No live ANZ job-ad scrape in this run; signals are synthesized and indicative. ANZ market may lag US/UK by 6–12 months.
- **Critical gaps:** Live ANZ job-ad scrape (last 90 days); UniMelb MC-IS granular graduate destination data; employer interviews from 3–5 regular MC-IS hiring organisations.

### 6. ASSESSMENT REDESIGN EXAMPLES
**SA&D — Redesigned:** Conduct an automation audit of three nominated business processes. For each: (1) identify AI substitution candidates with justification; (2) specify the human-in-the-loop boundary; (3) design a governance framework including failure-mode analysis and escalation protocols; (4) produce a change readiness brief for the executive sponsor. Defend in a 15-minute panel review.

**Capstone — Redesigned (all tracks):** Working with a confirmed industry client, design and document an AI workflow implementation. Deliverables: current-state automation audit; proposed AI workflow design with human-in-the-loop specification; governance and compliance framework (NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001, applicable sector regulation); change management plan; failure-mode and risk register; post-implementation measurement plan. Client must confirm the project addressed a real organizational problem.

**Lagging indicators (12–24 months):** Graduate placement in AI governance/automation roles 20%+ by 2028 · Graduate placement in regulated sector 30%+ by 2028 · Employer satisfaction 75%+ "well prepared" on AI readiness · DFVA score 23+ Month 12; 28+ Month 24 · Median time-to-employment ≤ 90 days

### 8. REDESIGNED GRADUATE PROFILE (2027 READY)
The 2027-ready MC-IS graduate arrives knowing the job title on their offer letter is probably not the role they'll be doing within 18 months — and they are ready for that. They have a sector (not "IT in general"), can build a basic data pipeline, and have a real-client capstone artifact: a documented AI workflow implementation including failure modes, governance framework, and change management plan. They do not use AI tools. They govern, supervise, and redesign them.

### 1. PROGRAM PROFILE

The Bachelor of Science at the University of Melbourne offers majors across biological, physical, mathematical, computational, and earth sciences. This assessment profiles three graduate clusters: **Cluster A \u2014 Life Sciences** (Biochemistry, Genetics, Microbiology, Zoology, Ecology); **Cluster B \u2014 Computational and Mathematical Sciences** (Mathematics, Statistics, Computing and Software Systems, Data Science); **Cluster C \u2014 Physical and Earth Sciences** (Physics, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Environmental Science). Key structural features: breadth subjects, optional Research Project capstone, optional Science Internship elective, and no mandatory AI or data science unit across all majors.

### 2. AUTOMATION EXPOSURE PROFILE

| Year | Typical Tasks | Automation Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | Lab technician support, data entry, routine testing, field assistant, RA documentation | HIGH \u2014 AI/robotics substitution path; cognitive layer compressing |
| Year 2\u20133 | Junior scientist, graduate data analyst, environmental consultant, science communicator | MEDIUM\u2013HIGH \u2014 Cluster B data roles face high substitution; Cluster C faces documentation compression |
| Year 4\u20137 | Research scientist (postgrad required), specialist consultant, biotech professional | LOW\u2013MEDIUM \u2014 Specialist depth creates automation resistance; most viable paths require postgraduate study |

**Structural risk:** A significant portion of B-Sci graduates enter the workforce with a generalist three-year science credential without specialist depth or postgraduate study. This cohort is particularly exposed \u2014 the degree signals broad scientific literacy but does not confer the expertise that creates genuine automation resistance.

### 3. DFVA SCORECARD

| # | Dimension | Score | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Automation Exposure of Roles | 2/3 | Cluster B graduates land in computational roles with judgment requirements; Cluster A and C face higher early-career routine work exposure. Mixed profile \u2014 entry is uneven. |
| 2 | Systems Thinking and Problem Framing | 2/3 | Science methodology teaches hypothesis formation and experimental design \u2014 genuine systems thinking. Trade-off reasoning and failure-mode analysis not consistently integrated across all majors. |
| 3 | Technical and Quantitative Depth | 3/3 | Strongest dimension. Majors in Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, and Chemistry carry genuine technical rigor. Third-year units are substantively demanding. |
| 4 | Decision-Making Under Uncertainty | 2/3 | Experimental science involves uncertainty. Research Project provides authentic exposure but is optional \u2014 many students graduate without a live high-stakes assessment. |
| 5 | AI Literacy and Governance | 1/3 | No mandatory AI literacy or governance unit across the degree. AI appears in computational majors as tooling but no governance framework is embedded at degree level. |
| 6 | Domain Depth and Specialization | 3/3 | Major structure provides genuine specialization. Third-year depth in Physics, Chemistry, Biochemistry, or Mathematics is substantive and not easily replicated. |
| 7 | Research Methods Rigor | 3/3 | Scientific method is core curriculum. All majors include experimental design, data collection, and interpretation. Honours stream adds full research methodology rigor. |
| 8 | Human and Relational Capability | 1/3 | Science degrees historically under-invest in interpersonal, ethical, and stakeholder capability. Breadth subjects provide exposure but not core assessment. |
| 9 | Curriculum Currency and Adaptability | 2/3 | 2026 handbook reflects ongoing review; some majors integrated data science tools. No degree-level AI core unit visible \u2014 significant currency gap. |
| 10 | Graduate Outcome Evidence | 2/3 | Faculty-level destination data published; major-level role-title and salary granularity not available. Partial transparency. |
| B | Irreplaceability Premium (Bonus) | 2/3 | Genuine dual-skill value for Cluster B graduates (quantitative + domain science). Physical and life science graduates have domain depth creating non-trivial automation resistance. Generalist graduates without postgrad study are weakly differentiated. |
| **TOTAL** | | **23/36 \u2014 MODERATE RISK** | |

### 4. THREE THRESHOLD QUESTIONS

**Q1: Could a well-prompted AI agent produce 80% of this graduate's first-two-year output?**
UNCERTAIN \u2014 highly major-dependent. For Cluster A research assistant roles: YES for documentation, literature review, data entry, and routine analysis. For Cluster B data analyst roles: YES for standard analysis and dashboard production. For Cluster C specialist geoscience/chemistry roles: NO \u2014 domain knowledge and instrument expertise create genuine automation friction.

**Q2: Does this program train graduates to design systems, own decisions, or generate original insight?**
YES \u2014 conditionally. The scientific method is fundamentally about generating original insight. This capability is fully realized only in students who complete third-year research projects and proceed to honours. Three-year graduates who have not engaged with the Research Project have weaker evidence.

**Q3: Will these graduates be more employable in 5 years than today, given AI trends?**
YES \u2014 for Cluster B and Cluster C specialists. UNCERTAIN \u2014 for Cluster A generalists. Graduates with deep quantitative, computational, or physical science expertise are increasingly valuable as the humans who can validate, interpret, and govern AI-generated scientific outputs.

### 5. ANALOGUE GRADUATE PROFILE

The most exposed B-Sci graduate is the **General Science Graduate of 2021**: broadly capable with solid scientific literacy, entering roles where AI tooling is absorbing the cognitive layer faster than the physical or domain-specialist layer. Specific threats: AlphaFold displacing structural biology prediction work; Elicit and Consensus replacing systematic review that RAs performed; lab automation compressing junior technician roles; GitHub Copilot and Julius AI absorbing Cluster B data analyst work; environmental modelling AI absorbing Cluster C junior interpretation roles.

### 6. VERDICT

**The Bachelor of Science is MODERATE RISK \u2014 a degree with genuine strengths that are unevenly distributed across its graduate population.**

Technical and quantitative rigor (D3: 3/3), domain depth (D6: 3/3), and research methods rigor (D7: 3/3) are legitimate and durable differentiators \u2014 fully realized only for graduates who specialize deeply and continue to postgraduate study.

Two critical gaps undermine the credential: **D5 \u2014 AI Literacy (1/3)**: a science degree in 2026 with no mandatory AI governance unit is a curriculum currency failure. **D8 \u2014 Human and Relational Capability (1/3)**: as AI absorbs the technical execution layer, interpersonal judgment and stakeholder communication become the primary human value-add \u2014 and the degree does not assess this.

The degree is a strong foundation that requires deliberate completion. Students who select a computationally intensive or specialist domain major, complete a research project, proceed to honours or postgraduate study, and actively build AI literacy alongside their degree will be well-positioned in 2027.

### 7. RECOMMENDATIONS

| Priority | Action | Dimension | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Select a major with genuine technical depth \u2014 Mathematics, Statistics, Physics, Chemistry, or Computing and Software Systems | D6, D3 | Low (decision at enrollment) |
| 2 | Complete the Research Project \u2014 optional but the single most important differentiator | D4, D7 | Medium |
| 3 | Build AI literacy deliberately: complete an AI governance certification (AWS AI Practitioner, Google AI Essentials) \u2014 the degree does not provide this | D5 | Low\u2013Medium |
| 4 | Proceed to honours or postgraduate study for research, clinical, or specialist consulting roles | D1, D6 | High |
| 5 | Complete the Science Internship elective \u2014 closes the decision-making and relational capability gap | D4, D8 | Medium |
| 6 | Develop science communication skills through student media, public engagement, or communication electives | D8 | Medium |
| 7 | For Cluster B majors: add Python depth, data engineering fundamentals, and ML model evaluation capability | D3, D5 | Medium |
| 8 | Target early-career roles in regulated domains where domain judgment is legally required | D1, D6 | High |

### 8. THE REDESIGNED GRADUATE PROFILE

The 2027-ready B-Sci graduate chose a major with genuine technical depth and completed it at the hardest available level. They did the Research Project in third year \u2014 primary data, defended methodology, genuine uncertainty about whether their results were correct. They understand AI tools as systems with failure modes, training biases, and governance requirements. They have a domain: not science in the broad sense, but a specific regulatory environment, instrument limitation set, or physical system. That domain knowledge is what makes their judgment non-replicable by a general-purpose agent. They can explain their work to a non-scientist \u2014 because in 2027, the value of scientific expertise is realized through collaboration, governance, and communication, not through technical execution alone.

### 2. RECENT JOB AD SIGNALS

**Signal 1 \u2014 RA and lab roles: cognitive layer compressing, physical layer stable.**
ANZ research assistant and laboratory scientist postings (Q1 2026) increasingly specify: ability to validate AI-generated experimental outputs, experience evaluating AI literature synthesis tools, research integrity compliance with AI disclosure requirements. Role volume flat; specification complexity rising sharply.

**Signal 2 \u2014 Data roles bifurcating sharply.**
ANZ data hiring (Q1 2026) splitting into: (a) analytics engineering and ML engineering (growing, require Python/dbt depth and model governance), and (b) standard data analyst/reporting analyst (declining, absorbed by AI tools). Cluster B graduates without Python depth or model evaluation capability face the compressing tier.

**Signal 3 \u2014 Environmental consulting raising the floor.**
AECOM, GHD, Jacobs, WSP ANZ graduate advertisements (Q4 2025\u2013Q1 2026) routinely include: familiarity with AI-assisted environmental modelling tools, ability to critically evaluate AI-generated assessment outputs. Language absent from equivalent 2023 graduate ads.

**Signal 4 \u2014 Government science roles requiring AI evaluation capability.**
APS science and policy graduate roles (Q4 2025\u2013Q1 2026) adding: ability to evaluate AI-generated evidence syntheses, AI literacy for evidence-based policy. Primary value-add for a science graduate in government is no longer producing evidence summaries \u2014 it is evaluating AI-generated ones.

**Signal 5 \u2014 Biotech and pharma adding regulatory AI literacy.**
CSL Behring, Telix, Starpharma, Moderna ANZ (Q1 2026) adding: familiarity with TGA AI framework, understanding of AI disclosure requirements in GMP contexts, ability to validate AI-assisted assay interpretation. New requirement cluster not present in 2023 graduate ads.

**Signal 6 \u2014 New role titles emerging for domain-AI integration.**
Seek ANZ new title appearances (Q4 2025\u2013Q1 2026): AI Research Scientist (Life Sciences) \u2014 12 ANZ postings; Scientific AI Validation Specialist \u2014 8 postings; Environmental AI Analyst \u2014 6 postings; Research Data Governance Officer \u2014 11 postings.

### 3. CURRENT DISCUSSION SIGNALS (X)

**Theme 1 \u2014 Is the research assistant role already gone?** Active discourse: AI tools have absorbed the cognitive and some physical components of junior RA work. Counter-view: AI has created new RA work \u2014 validating, governing, and interpreting AI outputs.

**Theme 2 \u2014 Junior data analyst is a dead-end title.** Dominant framing in Australian data professional networks: if your job is pulling reports and building dashboards, ChatGPT or Julius has your job.

**Theme 3 \u2014 AlphaFold didn't kill structural biology \u2014 it killed junior structural biology.** Remaining human work: experimental validation, failure-mode analysis, and judgment about when the model is wrong.

**Theme 4 \u2014 Environmental consulting needs people who can argue with the AI.** Anyone can run the model now \u2014 clients need someone who can tell them where the model is wrong and why.

**Theme 5 \u2014 CSIRO and ARC are hiring domain-AI hybrids.** Pure ML is a commodity. Domain science + ML is the scarce combination.

**Theme 6 \u2014 Science graduates need to learn to fact-check the AI, not just use it.** APS science managers: our graduate intake can use Copilot and Elicit but they cannot tell us whether the output is right.

| CI-7 | Major selection advising does not address AI substitution pressure by cluster | D1, D9 | Update major selection guides to include AI automation exposure by cluster |

### 6. EVIDENCE CONFIDENCE + GAPS

| Signal Area | Confidence | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| Job family identification | HIGH | Role taxonomy shifting faster than handbook data tracks |

| **TOTAL** | **23/36** | **MODERATE RISK** |

### 2. SCORE-TO-ACTION MAPPING
| Dimension | DFVA Score | Gap Diagnosis | Recommended Intervention |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 \u2014 Automation Exposure | 2/3 | Entry-level Cluster A and B graduates land in roles where AI is actively compressing the cognitive layer. Three-year generalist graduates most exposed. | Make Research Project mandatory. Require Science Internship. Reframe career advising around AI-augmented science roles. |
| D5 \u2014 AI Literacy and Governance | 1/3 | No mandatory AI governance unit. AI appears in computational majors as tooling but not as a governed, critically evaluated system. | Create mandatory core unit: AI in Scientific Research (tool evaluation, model limitation analysis, NIST AI RMF applied to research contexts). |
| D8 \u2014 Human and Relational Capability | 1/3 | Science degrees systematically under-invest in communication, ethical reasoning, and stakeholder engagement. As AI absorbs technical execution, this gap becomes structurally dangerous. | Create mandatory science communication and ethics unit with stakeholder-facing assessed deliverable. |
| D4 \u2014 Decision-Making | 2/3 | Research Project provides authentic uncertainty exposure but is not mandatory. Many graduates complete without a live high-stakes assessment. | Mandate Research Project for all students. Require Science Internship with assessed decision-making reflection. |
| D3 \u2014 Technical Depth | 3/3 | Strong. Risk is in Cluster A majors where quantitative rigor is lighter. | Maintain and defend. Audit quantitative requirements in life sciences majors. |
| D6 \u2014 Domain Depth | 3/3 | Strong. Risk is students selecting shallow majors to avoid difficulty. | Maintain depth requirements. Introduce major selection advising mapping AI substitution pressure to major choice. |
| D9 \u2014 Curriculum Currency | 2/3 | No degree-level AI governance content visible despite recent review. | Establish science curriculum advisory panel with annual review cycle and documented change tracking. |
| D10 \u2014 Graduate Outcome Evidence | 2/3 | Faculty-level data only; major-level granularity unavailable. | Publish major-level graduate destination data: role titles, salary bands, postgraduate study rates within 12 months. |

### 6. ASSESSMENT REDESIGN EXAMPLES

**Research Project \u2014 Redesigned:** Complete a supervised primary research project with: (1) a pre-registration document stating hypothesis, methodology, and predicted limitations before data collection; (2) primary data collection and analysis with documented methodology; (3) failure-mode and limitation analysis; (4) AI tool use reflection \u2014 if AI tools were used, document which tools, how outputs were validated, what the model's limitations are, and what would have been missed without human judgment; (5) 10-minute panel defence with examiner challenge. Client or supervisor accountability statement required.

**AI in Scientific Research \u2014 New Unit:** Assessment 1 (40%): Select an AI tool in your major's research domain. Produce a structured evaluation covering what the tool does, training data and biases, three failure modes, validation requirements before publishing, and accountability when the tool is wrong. Assessment 2 (60%): Advise a research group wanting to use an AI tool. Produce a governance brief using NIST AI RMF: tool assessment, research integrity checklist, disclosure and reproducibility requirements, and a justified go/no-go recommendation presented to a panel including a non-specialist.

**Science Communication and Ethics \u2014 Redesigned:** You are a scientist advising a government department on a topic within your major. Produce: (1) a stakeholder brief (800 words max) translating current evidence on a defined question for a non-specialist audience; (2) an AI disclosure statement covering tools used, output verification, and what required your judgment; (3) a live Q&A session (15 minutes) with a panel including at least one non-scientist.

### 8. REDESIGNED GRADUATE PROFILE (2027 READY)
The 2027-ready B-Sci graduate did not coast through a broad science degree hoping that scientific literacy would be enough. They chose a major with genuine technical depth, completed a primary research project with pre-registration and a defended methodology, and finished their degree able to look at an AI tool in their domain and tell you exactly where it fails. They completed a Science Internship in a regulated or high-stakes environment. Their graduation portfolio has three artifacts that no AI can produce for them: a primary research dataset with a defended methodology, an AI governance brief for a tool in their domain, and a stakeholder communication piece reviewed by a non-specialist panel. They are the person their research group or employer relies on to decide which AI outputs to trust \u2014 and why.

    title: "Bachelor of Design (B-Des) — Curriculum Improvement Plan",
    institution: "University of Melbourne",
    markdown: `## DFVA CURRICULUM IMPROVEMENT PLAN: Bachelor of Design

**Based on report:** Bachelor of Design, University of Melbourne — 21/36 MODERATE RISK — 2026-05-13 / https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2026/courses/b-des

### 1. DIAGNOSTIC SUMMARY

The Bachelor of Design scored **21/36 — MODERATE RISK**. Three critical 1/3 scores define the primary intervention targets.

| Dimension | Score | Status |
|---|---|---|
| D1 — Automation Exposure | 2/3 | Adequate |
| D2 — Systems Thinking | 2/3 | Adequate |
| D3 — Technical Depth | 1/3 | Critical gap |
| D4 — Decision-Making | 2/3 | Adequate |
| D5 — AI Literacy | 1/3 | Critical gap |
| D6 — Domain Depth | 2/3 | Adequate |
| D7 — Research Methods | 2/3 | Adequate |
| D8 — Human/Relational | 3/3 | Strong |
| D9 — Curriculum Currency | 2/3 | Adequate |
| D10 — Graduate Outcome Evidence | 1/3 | Critical gap |
| B — Irreplaceability Premium | 2/3 | Adequate |
| **TOTAL** | **21/36** | **MODERATE RISK** |

The B-Des has a genuine human-relational strength (D8: 3/3). Studio culture, critique practice, and embodied making are not easily replicated by AI. Three 1/3 scores represent the degree’s primary intervention targets: technical depth, AI literacy and governance, and graduate outcome evidence.

### 2. SCORE-TO-ACTION MAPPING

| Dimension | DFVA Score | Gap Diagnosis | Recommended Intervention |
|---|---|---|---|
| D3 — Technical Depth | 1/3 | No mandatory prototyping, code literacy, or data fluency. Graduates cannot direct or govern AI tools they cannot technically understand. | Create mandatory technical foundations unit: prototyping tools (Figma, Framer), front-end literacy (HTML/CSS/JS concepts), data visualisation. |
| D5 — AI Literacy | 1/3 | No mandatory AI governance unit. AI tools appear in studio but not as critically evaluated systems. | Create mandatory core unit: AI in Design Practice — tool evaluation, output critique, prompt governance, IP and ethics. |
| D10 — Outcome Evidence | 1/3 | No publicly available granular destination data at specialisation level. | Publish specialisation-level destination data: role titles, industries, salary bands, time-to-employment. |
| D4 — Decision-Making | 2/3 | Simulated briefs limit authentic accountability. Studio critique does not replicate live-client uncertainty. | Mandate live-client capstone for all students. Replace simulated final-year briefs with real industry, government, or community partner projects. |
| D6 — Domain Depth | 2/3 | Specialisation depth varies; Interaction Design lacks regulatory and technical grounding. | Add WCAG 2.2 AA, platform design systems, and AI interaction pattern design to Interaction specialisation. |
| D7 — Research Methods | 2/3 | Primarily qualitative. Quantitative methods under-represented, limiting ability to defend design decisions with data. | Add quantitative design research component: usability testing statistics, survey design, A/B test interpretation. |

Graduation portfolio first full cohort (B: 2→3). External validation: AI in Design Practice mapped against Creative Australia AI ethics framework and AGDA professional standards.

### 7. ASSESSMENT REDESIGN EXAMPLES

**Example A — Capstone Studio (Redesigned):** Complete a major design project for a live industry, government, or community partner. Required: co-designed brief with documented constraints; research phase using both qualitative and quantitative methods; design decision log documenting all major trade-offs; AI tool use reflection declaring which tools were used, how outputs were evaluated, what required human judgment; live presentation to client stakeholders with challenge questions; client satisfaction statement. Assessment criteria: research rigour, decision accountability, AI governance, stakeholder communication, and design resolution. Dimensions: D4, D5, D7, D8, B.

**Example B — AI in Design Practice (New Unit):** Assessment 1 (40%): Select an AI design tool relevant to your specialisation. Produce a structured evaluation: what the tool does; training data basis and biases; three specific failure modes; IP and copyright risk assessment; a governance recommendation for commercial use. Assessment 2 (60%): You are the lead designer on a project where the client wants to use AI tools to accelerate delivery. Produce a design direction brief: AI workflow map showing which tasks are AI-assisted and which are human-led; quality assurance protocol for AI-generated outputs; IP and ethics disclosure for the client; design rationale explaining what AI cannot replace; present to a panel including at least one non-designer. Dimensions: D5, D2, D4, D1.

**Example C — Design and Technology Integration (Assessed Prototype):** Produce a functional interactive prototype using Figma or Framer, including: a basic HTML/CSS implementation demonstrating understanding of build constraints; a data visualisation component using real data; an accessibility audit against WCAG 2.2 AA with documented remediation decisions. No prior coding experience assumed. Assessment criteria: prototype fidelity, build-constraint awareness, data integration, accessibility compliance. Dimensions: D3, D6, B.

### 8. AI GOVERNANCE AND QUALITY CONTROLS

**AI tool disclosure policy:** All studio units adopt a consistent AI disclosure policy by Sem 1 2027. Students declare AI tool use in a reflection log for all major assessments — a professional practice habit, not a prohibition.

**AI in Design Practice currency:** The unit coordinator must review and update the AI tool landscape each semester. Design AI is moving faster than annual curriculum review cycles.

**Live-client AI disclosure:** Any capstone project using AI tools must include a client-facing AI disclosure statement. This normalises professional-grade AI governance from graduation.

**Portfolio authenticity controls:** All portfolio artifacts require a process documentation component. AI-generated outputs without documented human direction and critique do not meet portfolio standards.

**COMPASS assessment controls:** Re-run COMPASS assessment annually after each advisory panel review. Score changes of ±3 in any dimension trigger curriculum review within 60 days.

### 9. MEASUREMENT PLAN

**Leading indicators (12 months):** AI in Design Practice unit live Sem 1 2027 · Student AI tool evaluation competency 80%+ · Design and Technology Integration unit approved Sem 2 2027 · Careers advising updated Month 3 · MSD advisory panel constituted Month 6 · Specialisation destination data instruments live Month 6 · Live-client capstone partners confirmed Month 9.

**Lagging indicators (12–24 months):** Graduate placement in AI-direction or strategy roles 30%+ of cohort by 2028 · Employer satisfaction with technical readiness 70%+ rating well prepared · Employer satisfaction with AI governance readiness 70%+ rating well prepared · DFVA score 24–25 by Month 12; 31–33 by Month 24 · Live-client capstone completion rate 100% by 2028 · Time-to-employment median ≤90 days post-graduation.

### 10. RISKS, TRADE-OFFS, AND DEPENDENCIES

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Academic governance delays technical unit beyond 2028 | MEDIUM | HIGH | Begin consultation Month 1; frame as design professional literacy, not coding requirement; pilot as elective in 2027 while mandate is in approval |
| AI in Design Practice unit resisted as “not design” by studio faculty | MEDIUM | HIGH | Frame as design governance and direction; invite industry co-designers with design backgrounds; use design critique methodology in assessment structure |
| Live-client capstone partner pipeline insufficient | MEDIUM | HIGH | Begin partner audit Month 3; expand to government, NFP, and social enterprise; allow research-group embedded projects as alternative |
| Specialisation destination data requires IT system investment beyond Faculty control | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Partner with Institutional Research early; frame as student recruitment value proposition |
| Technical unit adds assessment load disadvantaging part-time or international students | LOW–MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Design unit around design direction, not coding fluency; no prior technical experience assumed |

**Key trade-offs:** Studio culture vs. technical mandate: Making a technical foundations unit mandatory changes the character of the degree. Some studio faculty will resist. The trade-off is necessary — a design degree that produces graduates unable to prototype at industry pace or evaluate AI tool outputs is not preparing them for 2027. Frame it as expanding the definition of design craft, not replacing it.

**Dependencies:** MSD advisory panel must be constituted before AI in Design Practice learning outcomes can be externally validated. Specialisation destination data requires Careers and Employability and Institutional Research partnership. Live-client capstone depends on industry partner network capacity — stress-test before mandate.

### 11. REDESIGNED GRADUATE PROFILE (2027 READY)

The 2027-ready B-Des graduate understood that directing an AI design tool without technical literacy is like directing a film without understanding the camera. They completed AI in Design Practice in second year and came out understanding that Figma AI generates components but cannot make the judgment call about whether the interaction pattern serves the user. They know what Midjourney’s training data biases are, why that matters for representation in brand work, and what a client disclosure statement needs to say.

They built a functional interactive prototype — not because they became a developer, but because they know exactly what constraints the build team is working within, and they can prototype fast enough to test an idea before anyone writes a line of production code.

Their capstone was a live project with a real government or industry client. They presented to stakeholders who asked hard questions they did not know the answer to in advance. Their design decision log shows every trade-off they made and why. Their client satisfaction statement is in their portfolio.

They are the graduate that a design strategy team, a service design consultancy, or an AI product company hires because they can do something that AI cannot: sit in a room with a human being, understand what that person actually needs, make a judgment call about what matters, and then direct the tools — AI and human — to get there.
